## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code in this project is written in the Python, and the specific version is `3.6.*`.

The libraries required to run all the code in this project have been documented in the file named requirements.txt.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I am very interested in Stackoverflowâ€™s developer survey data from 2017, and intend to make targeted exploration. I will study these data to clarify the following questions:

1. How many of the people involved in the survey are programming lover?
2. For professional developers, is there a correlation between their programming hobby and their programming experience or the number of years of coded job?
3. For professional developers, are their programming hobby related to their job satisfaction or career satisfaction?
4. Is there a clear correlation between programming hobby and salary?

All of these questions are actually presented to validate a hypothesis. The hypothesis is: Loving programming is really important for professional developers. This hypothesis may also be valid, or it may not be valid. I can't be sure until I finish my study.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

In addition, the project also contains some Python source files. The code in the notebook references these files. These files contain some code for processing and analyzing the data. Most of the code is more complex, so I don't think it's appropriate to put it in the notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hyper0x/is-it-really-important-for-professional-developers-to-love-programming-a68f0d5373fb).
